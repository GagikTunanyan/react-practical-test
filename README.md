# React Practical Test

This is a technical interview test app built with React and TypeScript. The goal is to evaluate the ability to identify and resolve bugs, improve code structure, and implement features based on existing `TODO` comments.

## 🛠️ Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- SCSS Modules
- Context API

## 📦 Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GagikTunanyan/react-practical-test.git
cd react-practical-test
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🧪 What to Focus On

The codebase includes various `TODO` comments throughout the app that highlight:

- 🐛 Bugs that need fixing
- 🎯 Missing or incomplete features
- 🧹 Code that could be optimized or refactored
- 🌐 Potential improvements for accessibility or UX

This project is intentionally left in an incomplete state to simulate real-world problem-solving scenarios during technical interviews.
